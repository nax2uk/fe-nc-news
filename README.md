# Northcoders News Server (Front-End)

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website which has been created using React.js.

Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics. 
Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. 
Users can also add comments about an article. 
Comments can also be up or down voted. 
A user can add comments and remove any comments which they have added.

Data is fetched using a RESTful API which has also been built by me. (See Links)
